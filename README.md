# ConfCal

This project will be a simple list of recurring conferences and events, with a
general idea of when they occur during the year.

The idea is that conferences are generally the same time each year, and the
problem is knowing when to start worrying about booking tickets, or sending in
talk proposals. Other conference calendars can get out of date because they
try to be too specific.

Hopefully this doesn't just add to the noise, but is actually useful.
